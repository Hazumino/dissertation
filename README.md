Analysing Government Policies on reproduction of COVID-19 via Parameter Estimation Methods

## Methodology
A slightly modified version of the epidemiological SIR model is utilised, the SIRD model. This model splits the Removed compartment into: Removed (Alive) and Dead. This is useful to us since deaths recorded is one of the more common data available to us. We can then utilise this information to do parameter estimation to obtain the parameters of the model.:
- $/gamma$
- $/alpha$
